# User can deposit more than collateral user capacity

## Summary
Everytime user want to deposit a specific token that protocol will check the balance of user for that token that not be greater than collateral user capacity but user can deposit more than threshold in first deposit ,because for first time [accountProps.getTokenAmount(token)](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-elfi-protocol/blob/main/elfi-perp-contracts/contracts/process/AssetsProcess.sol#L96) always would be zero  and user can deposit every amount even greater than threshold

## Vulnerability Detail
For example collateralUserCap has been set 10e18 for WETH and Alice want to deposit for first time
and Alice deposit 11e18 and this will be  successful because accountProps.getTokenAmount(token) returns zero and zero is less than collateralUserCap[10e18]

## Impact
User can deposit more than collateral user capacity

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
```diff
-            if (accountProps.getTokenAmount(token) > tradeTokenConfig.collateralUserCap) { //@audit user can deposit 
+           if (accountProps.getTokenAmount(token) + params.amount > tradeTokenConfig.collateralUserCap)
more than max value
                revert Errors.CollateralUserCapOverflow(token, tradeTokenConfig.collateralUserCap);
            }
```
