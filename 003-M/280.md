# Insufficient Collateral Cap Check Allowing Collateral Overflow

## Summary
The vulnerability is in the `deposit` function. When performing a collateral cap check for user deposits, the function does not consider the newly deposited collateral amount in the user's balance. This can result in the user's total collateral surpassing the allowed collateral cap.
## Vulnerability Detail
the issue lies with this check 
```solidity
if (accountProps.getTokenAmount(token) > tradeTokenConfig.collateralUserCap) {
                revert Errors.CollateralUserCapOverflow(token, tradeTokenConfig.collateralUserCap);
            }
```
which doesn't consider the new collateral amount added which lead to it breaking the invariant of collateral cap.


## Impact
Breaking the collateral cap
