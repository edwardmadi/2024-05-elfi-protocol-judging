# The `AssetsProcess.withdraw()` function doesn't update the `CommonData`

## Summary

The `withdraw()` function does not modify the `tradeCollateralTokenDatas` property in the `CommonData`.

## Vulnerability Detail

Withdrawing reduces the total collateral. Therefore, the [withdraw()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-elfi-protocol/blob/main/elfi-perp-contracts/contracts/process/AssetsProcess.sol#L122-L155) function should decrease the  `tradeCollateralTokenDatas[token].totalCollateral` in the `CommonData` accordingly. However, this logic is currently missing. As a result, the value of `tradeCollateralTokenDatas[token].totalCollateral` will exceed the actual collateral amount, leading to smaller available deposit amounts than it should be. Since the `tradeCollateralTokenDatas[token].totalCollateral` value never decreases, it could reach the `collateralTotalCap`, making future deposits impossible.

## Impact

The available deposit amount becomes smaller than it should be. Additionally, `tradeCollateralTokenDatas[token].totalCollateral`  could reach the `collateralTotalCap`, resulting in deposits becoming impossible.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It is recommended to update the the `CommonData` accordingly.

```diff
+       CommonData.load().subTradeTokenCollateral(token, params.amount);
```
