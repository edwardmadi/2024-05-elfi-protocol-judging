# `tradeCollateralTokenDatas[token].totalCollateral` is never reduced

## Summary

The `totalCollateral` variable is increased on deposits, but not decreased on withdrawals, which leads to DoS.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `totalCollateral` variable saves the global amount of tokens deposited by all users and is used for the following check in the deposit flow:

```solidity
uint256 collateralAmount = commonData.getTradeTokenCollateral(token);
if (collateralAmount + params.amount > tradeTokenConfig.collateralTotalCap) {
 revert Errors.CollateralTotalCapOverflow(token, tradeTokenConfig.collateralTotalCap);
}
```

This checks if the total amount of deposits + the new deposit amount would exceed the `collateralTotalCap`.

The `totalCollateral` value is increased on every deposit, but not decreased on withdrawals, therefore this variable can only go up and will lead to reverts as soon as it reaches the `collateralTotalCap`.

## Impact

The variable can never be reduced, therefore the given check is not working correctly and leads to DoS.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Reduce the `tradeCollateralTokenDatas[token].totalCollateral` value on withdrawals with the `subTradeTokenLiability` function that is never used.
