# Users cannot withdraw their assets if admin omit specific token from trade token list

## Summary
[Admin maybe decide to omit specific token from trade token list](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-elfi-protocol/blob/main/elfi-perp-contracts/contracts/storage/AppTradeConfig.sol#L84) and this can have many reason and when admin does this action, users cannot withdraw their token

## Vulnerability Detail
when a user makes a withdraw request and after that, the keeper executes the user's request executeWithdraw function calls the executeWithdraw function after withdraw function is called and the withdraw function checks token supports collateral or not and [if the token does not support collateral doesn't allow withdraw process continues](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-elfi-protocol/blob/main/elfi-perp-contracts/contracts/process/AssetsProcess.sol#L126) and this causes the withdraw process stops

## Impact

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
```diff
    function withdraw(uint256 requestId, WithdrawParams memory params) public {
        if (params.amount == 0) {
            revert Errors.AmountZeroNotAllowed();
        }
-        if (!AppTradeTokenConfig.getTradeTokenConfig(params.token).isSupportCollateral) {
-            revert Errors.OnlyCollateralSupported();
        }
```
