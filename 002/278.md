# Unrestricted Access to batchUpdateAccountToken Allows Unauthorized Token Balance Modification

## Summary
The vulnerability lies in the batchUpdateAccountToken function. This function lacks proper access control, allowing any user to call it and potentially manipulate their own or other users' token balances. This issue can lead to draining the protocol's funds or causing a griefing attack by modifying other users' balances.

## Vulnerability Detail
Here is a simple scenario
- Bob deposit 100 sol
- Bob calls `batchUpdateAccountToken` with params sol and 100 
```solidity
function batchUpdateAccountToken(AssetsProcess.UpdateAccountTokenParams calldata params) external override {
        AddressUtils.validEmpty(params.account);
        AssetsProcess.updateAccountToken(params);
    }
```
- this executes `updateAccountToken` in `AssetsProcess.sol`
- which executes 
```solidity=
if (params.changedTokenAmounts[i] > 0) {
                accountProps.addToken(params.tokens[i], params.changedTokenAmounts[i].toUint256());
                accountProps.repayLiability(params.tokens[i]);
            }
```
- which will increase Bob's of SOL with another 100 token
- Bob can either use that as new margin for his positions which can lead to him not liquidated 
- withdraw the new funds leading to him draining the protocol reserve
- he can use the same strategy to repay liabilities and borrow as much as he needs from the protocol.

Another Scenario
- Alice deposits 100 sol
- Alice execute a withdraw requests
- Attacker frontrun the withdraw request and call `batchUpdateAccountToken` on Alice's behalf and reduce her sol balance by 100
- this will lead to her balance being 0 leading to the withdraw being reverted and her losing funds


## Impact
Loss of funds for both users and protocol
