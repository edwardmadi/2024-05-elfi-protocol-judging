# OrderProcess._getExecutionPrice() has a logic error  for calculating the execution price of LIMIT or (STOP/TAKE_PROFIT) orders

## Summary
OrderProcess._getExecutionPrice() has a logic error  for calculating the execution price of LIMIT or (STOP/TAKE_PROFIT) orders. As a result, the execution price might be wrong or the execution order might fail due to invalid exception. 

## Vulnerability Detail

When a user execute an order, the  OrderProcess._getExecutionPrice() function is used to calculate the execution price:

However, for the LIMIT or STOP/TAKE Profit orders, the following code snippet has a logic error: 

```javascript
if (
            Order.Type.LIMIT == order.orderType ||
            (Order.Type.STOP == order.orderType && Order.StopType.TAKE_PROFIT == order.stopType)
        ) {
            if ((isLong && order.triggerPrice >= currentPrice) || (!isLong && order.triggerPrice <= currentPrice)) {
                return currentPrice;
            }
            revert Errors.ExecutionPriceInvalid();
        }
```
For long orders, a valid order needs to make sure that the current price is greater than or equal to ``order.triggerPrice``, not the other way around; similary, for short orders, a valid order needs to make sure that the current price is smaller or equal to ``order.triggerPrice``. However, the code above does not opposite logic. 

## Impact
OrderProcess._getExecutionPrice() has a logic error  for calculating the execution price of LIMIT or (STOP/TAKE_PROFIT) orders. As a result, the execution price might be wrong or the execution order might fail due to invalid exception.

## Recommendation
Fix the logic as follows:
```javascript
if (
            Order.Type.LIMIT == order.orderType ||
            (Order.Type.STOP == order.orderType && Order.StopType.TAKE_PROFIT == order.stopType)
        ) {
            if ((isLong && order.triggerPrice <= currentPrice) || (!isLong && order.triggerPrice >= currentPrice)) {
                return currentPrice;
            }
            revert Errors.ExecutionPriceInvalid();
        }
```
