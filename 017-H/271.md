# ERC20 transfers for stakeToken's is not updating the rewards process

## Summary
Since the stakeToken's are ERC20 the transfers of these tokens should also change the rewards since the ownership of the tokens will change after the transfer
## Vulnerability Detail
As we can see, when an account mints new stake tokens, the fee rewards are updated:
```solidity
function executeMintStakeToken(
        uint256 requestId,
        Mint.Request memory mintRequest
    ) external returns (uint256 stakeAmount) {
        -> FeeRewardsProcess.updateAccountFeeRewards(mintRequest.account, mintRequest.stakeToken);
       //..
    }
```

This is crucial to ensure fair accrual of rewards for the users.

However, there is another case where the account's fee rewards will change: when they simply transfer their tokens. All stake tokens are ERC20 tokens, and they have transfer functions that users can use.
## Impact
Unfair accrual of rewards, high.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Override the transfer hook in ERC20 and update the rewards whenever the tokens are transferred
