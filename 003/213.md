# Logical error in the processExecutionFee function GasProcess.sol


## Summary
Logical error in the processExecutionFee function GasProcess.sol, lossFee will always be 0

## Vulnerability Detail
```javascript
 function processExecutionFee(PayExecutionFeeParams memory cache) external {
        /// @dev Calculates the gas used
        uint256 usedGas = cache.startGas - gasleft();
        /// @dev Calculates the execution fee based on gas used and gas price
        uint256 executionFee = usedGas * tx.gasprice;
        uint256 refundFee;
        uint256 lossFee;

        if (executionFee > cache.userExecutionFee) {
@>>            executionFee = cache.userExecutionFee;
@>>            lossFee = executionFee - cache.userExecutionFee;
        } else {
            /// @dev Calculates the refund fee if execution fee is less than user's fee
            refundFee = cache.userExecutionFee - executionFee;
        }

        /// @dev Transfers the user's execution fee to the contract
        VaultProcess.transferOut(
            cache.from,
            AppConfig.getChainConfig().wrapperToken,
            address(this),
            cache.userExecutionFee
        );

        /// @dev Withdraws the execution fee to the keeper
        VaultProcess.withdrawEther(cache.keeper, executionFee);

        if (refundFee > 0) {
            /// @dev Refunds the remaining fee to the user's account
            VaultProcess.withdrawEther(cache.account, refundFee);
        }

        if (lossFee > 0) {
            /// @dev Records the loss fee
            CommonData.addLossExecutionFee(lossFee);
        }
    }
```
Since executionFee equals cache.userExecutionFee, lossFee will always be 0. Therefore, the cumulative value of LossExecutionFee will be less than the actual amount. The actual ExecutionFee loss is greater than the recorded value and They could pose risks in future integrations.

## Impact
The actual ExecutionFee loss is greater than the recorded value and They could pose risks in future integrations.

## Recommendation
```diff
if (executionFee > cache.userExecutionFee) {
-           executionFee = cache.userExecutionFee;
-           lossFee = executionFee - cache.userExecutionFee;
+           lossFee = executionFee - cache.userExecutionFee;
+           executionFee = cache.userExecutionFee;
        } else {
            /// @dev Calculates the refund fee if execution fee is less than user's fee
            refundFee = cache.userExecutionFee - executionFee;
        }
```
