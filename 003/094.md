# Miscalculation results in the protocol not accounting for and managing actual losses incurred by the keeper.

## Summary
`lossFee` is always 0 when the `executionFee` exceeds the `userExecutionFee`.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `processExecutionFee` function is designed to calculate and handle the execution fee required by the keeper and ensure that this fee is appropriately managed between the user and the keeper. The function also addresses scenarios where the actual gas cost exceeds or falls below the user's provided execution fee. However, there is a logical error in the calculation of the `lossFee`.

The lossFee is calculated as `executionFee - cache.userExecutionFee` when `executionFee` exceeds `cache.userExecutionFee`. However, since `executionFee` is set to `cache.userExecutionFee` in this case, the calculation `executionFee - cache.userExecutionFee` always results in 0(lossFee).

## Recommendation

```diff
        if (executionFee > cache.userExecutionFee) {
+          lossFee = executionFee - cache.userExecutionFee;
            executionFee = cache.userExecutionFee;
-           lossFee = executionFee - cache.userExecutionFee;
        } else {
            refundFee = cache.userExecutionFee - executionFee;
        }
