# Keepers can steal additional execution fee from users in `processExecutionFee` function


## Summary
The `processExecutionFee` function is designed to compensate keepers for their execution work and refund any excess fees back to the user.
However, due to the implementation not considering EIP-150, a malicious keeper can exploit this to drain all execution fees paid by users, irrespective of the actual execution costs.


## Vulnerability Detail
All execution functions called by the keeper invoke the `processExecutionFee` function to handle fee payments.
For example, the `OrderFacet.executeOrder` function is an `external` function subject to EIP-150, which restricts the gas available to sub-contracts.
Specifically, only 63/64 of the gas is passed to the GasUtils sub-contract, while the remaining 1/64 is reserved and refunded to the keeper (msg.sender) after the transaction completes.

However, the calculation of gasUsed mistakenly includes this reserved gas portion.
Since setting `tx.gaslimit` does not impact the actual gas cost of the transaction, the excess gas is refunded to the keeper.
This allows the keeper to artificially inflate `tx.gaslimit` to manipulate the calculation of [`gasUsed`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-elfi-protocol/blob/main/elfi-perp-contracts/contracts/process/GasProcess.sol#L18).

## Impact
Malicious keepers can exploit this flaw to steal additional execution fees from users.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
To prevent keepers from exploiting the `processExecutionFee` function and stealing excess execution fees, adjust the `usedGas` calculation to ensure that only the actual gas cost is considered, excluding the reserved gas portion.
