# Stop orders will be canceled if users decrease their positions

## Summary
when users open a position and set stop loss and take profit order for invest management they have to pay cost as execution fee but when users want to decrease their position's margin all of stop orders for [that position will be canceled](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-elfi-protocol/blob/main/elfi-perp-contracts/contracts/process/DecreasePositionProcess.sol#L171) and this can cause user will lose

## Vulnerability Detail
1-Alice opens position at $3800 with initialMargin 1 WETH on ETHUSD
2-Alice sets stop loss order at $3500
3-Alice sets take profit order at $4300
after a while price reaches to $4000 and Alice will decide to reduce her position to 0.80 initialMargin but when Alice will this action all stop orders will be canceled and she has to set them again and this has cost for him

## Impact
Stop orders will be canceled if users decrease their positions

Manual Review

## Recommendation
```diff
+ if (params.decreaseQty == position.qty)
        CancelOrderProcess.cancelStopOrders(
            cache.position.account,
            symbolProps.code,
            cache.position.marginToken,
            cache.position.isCrossMargin,
            CancelOrderProcess.CANCEL_ORDER_POSITION_CLOSE,
            params.requestId
        );
```
