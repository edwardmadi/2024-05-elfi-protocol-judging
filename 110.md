# Users with no balance can initiate withdrawals stuffing the keeper task logs

## Summary
Since the protocol uses a FIFO withdrawal batch queue for processing user withdrawals and the contracts will be deployed on Abritrum and Base, users with no balance to their account can initiate withdrawals stuffing the keeper task, FIFO queue and utilizing excessive protocol resource towards a DoS for other legitimate users whose withdrawal transactions will be placed last in the queue.

## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
function createWithdrawRequest(address token, uint256 amount) external override {
        AddressUtils.validEmpty(token);

        if (amount == 0) {
            revert Errors.AmountZeroNotAllowed();
        }
@>        AssetsProcess.createWithdrawRequest(token, amount); // entry for withdrawals. user has no balance in their amount, creates a withdraw request for 50 tokens
    }

function createWithdrawRequest(address token, uint256 amount) external { // withdraw request is logged and queued
        uint256 requestId = UuidCreator.nextId(WITHDRAW_ID_KEY);
        Withdraw.Request storage request = Withdraw.create(requestId);
        request.account = msg.sender;
        request.token = token;
        request.amount = amount; // amount is set but user has no balance to their account meeting that amount or no balance at all

        emit CreateWithdrawEvent(requestId, request);
    }

function executeWithdraw(uint256 requestId, Withdraw.Request memory request) external {
        
@>        withdraw(requestId, WithdrawParams(address(0), request.account, request.token, request.amount)); // keeper attempts withdraw
        
        Withdraw.remove(requestId);

        emit WithdrawSuccessEvent(requestId, request);
    }

function withdraw(uint256 requestId, WithdrawParams memory params) public {
        if (params.amount == 0) {
            revert Errors.AmountZeroNotAllowed();
        }
        if (!AppTradeTokenConfig.getTradeTokenConfig(params.token).isSupportCollateral) {
            revert Errors.OnlyCollateralSupported();
        }
        Account.Props storage accountProps = Account.load(params.account);

        if (accountProps.getTokenAmount(params.token) < params.amount) {
@>            revert Errors.WithdrawWithNoEnoughAmount(); // withdraw fails because the account has no such balance to meet the requested amount
        }
    ...
    }

function cancelWithdraw(uint256 requestId, Withdraw.Request memory request, bytes32 reasonCode) external {
        Withdraw.remove(requestId); // withdraw transaction is then dropped from the FIFO queue but next withdraw request in the queue is from the same user with no such amount
        emit CancelWithdrawEvent(requestId, request, reasonCode);
    }
```

## Impact
DoS of Withdrawal functionality for as long as the attacker has enough gas resources for e.g 1 week or more. The idea is to figure out just how much withdrawal transactions the keepers can complete every 24 hours and then stuff the FIFO queue with the limit times 7 (x * 7 days) towards a 7-day withdrawal DoS or more.
