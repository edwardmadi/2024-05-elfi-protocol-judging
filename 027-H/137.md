# Redeeming stake tokens is not updating the pool's borrowing fee rate

## Summary
Just like minting new stake tokens, redeeming minting stake tokens also changes the pools base amount without updating the pools borrowing fee rate. 
## Vulnerability Detail
When stake tokens are redeemed, the base amount changes:
```solidity
function _executeRedeemStakeToken(
        LpPool.Props storage pool,
        Redeem.Request memory params,
        address baseToken
    ) internal returns (uint256) {
        //.
        -> pool.subPoolAmount(pool.baseToken, cache.redeemTokenAmount);
        .
    }
```

However, this change does not update the overall borrowing fee rate.
## Impact
Unfair accrual of borrowing fees. It can yield on lesser/higher fees for lps and position holders. It can also delay or cause unfair liquidations. Hence, high.
