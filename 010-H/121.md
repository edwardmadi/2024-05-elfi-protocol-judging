# LP rewards are accumulated after burning in the redeem flow

## Summary

In the redemption process for LPs, the tokens are burned before the rewards are accumulated. This can lead to a total loss of staking rewards for the LP.

## Vulnerability Detail

Here we can see that the rewards are accumulated after burning the stake tokens:

```solidity
function executeRedeemStakeToken(uint256 requestId, Redeem.Request memory redeemRequest) external {

 // these functions burn the LP tokens
 uint256 redeemAmount;
 if (CommonData.getStakeUsdToken() == redeemRequest.stakeToken) {
 redeemAmount = _redeemStakeUsd(redeemRequest);
 } else if (CommonData.isStakeTokenSupport(redeemRequest.stakeToken)) {
 redeemAmount = _redeemStakeToken(redeemRequest);
 } else {
 revert Errors.StakeTokenInvalid(redeemRequest.stakeToken);
 }

 // this function accumulates the rewards for all LP tokens the user owns
 FeeRewardsProcess.updateAccountFeeRewards(redeemRequest.account, redeemRequest.stakeToken);

 Redeem.remove(requestId);

 emit RedeemSuccessEvent(requestId, redeemAmount, redeemRequest);
}
```

Therefore all unclaimed rewards for the redeemed tokens are lost as the `updateAccountFeeRewards` function does not calculate with the just burned tokens.

The worst-case scenario looks like the following:

- User stakes a huge amount of tokens
- User never claims rewards
- User withdraws after a long time
- The user made a loss because of the fees and did not receive any rewards for staking
- The rewards are socialized among all other LPs

## Impact

Loss of staking rewards for the LP.
