# stakers loss their reward if they redeem their xToken

## Summary
staker has to create redeem request for redeeming their tokens and after that keeper execute their request and when keeper calls executeRedeemStakeToken function and after redeem staker's funds executeRedeemStakeToken function calls updateAccountFeeRewards function and this function will check if stake token balance is zero that only [updates openRewardsPerStakeToken to current cumulativeRewardsPerStakeToken](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-elfi-protocol/blob/main/elfi-perp-contracts/contracts/process/FeeRewardsProcess.sol#L81) and this causes staker loss their reward


## Vulnerability Detail
claimRewards function uses realisedRewardsTokenAmount for paying reward to stakers and when this property is zero the protocol doesn't pay any reward and realisedRewardsTokenAmount computes based on gap between getCumulativeRewardsPerStakeToken and openRewardsPerStakeToken and when executeRedeemStakeToken will call updateAccountFeeRewards function that replaces openRewardsPerStakeToken with current cumulativeRewardsPerStakeToken
if user stake balance is zero

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Its better when user redeems their tokens the protocol automatically pays user's reward or burn stake token after updateAccountFeeRewards function
