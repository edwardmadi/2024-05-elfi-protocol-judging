# Reentrancy Vulnerability

## Summary
The `transfer` function in `TranferUtils.sol` contains a potential reentrancy vulnerability. Despite using a gas limit, the function makes an external call to transfer ERC-20 tokens without reentrancy protection. This could allow malicious contracts to exploit the reentrancy vulnerability.
## Vulnerability Detail
If the recipient of the tokens is a contract with a fallback or receive function, this external call could trigger reentrancy, allowing the contract to call back into the transfer function before the initial execution completes.
## Impact
If exploited, a reentrancy attack could allow an attacker to repeatedly call the transfer function before the previous execution completes.
## Code Snippet

    function transfer(address token, address receiver, uint256 amount) external {
        if (amount == 0) {
            return;
        }
        bool success = transferWithGasLimit(IERC20(token), receiver, amount, TRANSFER_GAS_LIMIT);
        if (!success) {
            revert TokenTransferError(token, receiver, amount);
        }
    }
