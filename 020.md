# Hard-Coded Gas Fee Limits

## Severity
Medium

## Summary
~ In the [smart contract configuratio](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-elfi-protocol/blob/main/elfi-perp-contracts/config/common.ts)n there are multiple gas fee limits that are hard-coded to a specific value (1,500,000). This practice will lead to inefficiencies and transaction failures due to varying network conditions, impacting the usability and reliability of the smart contract.

## Vulnerability Detail
~ The [smart contract configuration](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-elfi-protocol/blob/main/elfi-perp-contracts/config/common.ts) sets fixed gas fee limits for various operations. Hard-coding these limits does not account for dynamic network conditions, hence causing transactions to fail and users to overpay for gas in some cases. This will affect the efficiency and usability of the smart contract.

~ https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-elfi-protocol/blob/main/elfi-perp-contracts/config/common.ts
~ The following is a the affected code snippet:

`
mintGasFeeLimit: 1_500_000,
redeemGasFeeLimit: 1_500_000,
placeIncreaseOrderGasFeeLimit: 1_500_000,
placeDecreaseOrderGasFeeLimit: 1_500_000,
positionUpdateMarginGasFeeLimit: 1_500_000,
positionUpdateLeverageGasFeeLimit: 1_500_000,
withdrawGasFeeLimit: 1_500_000,
claimRewardsGasFeeLimit: 1_500_000,
`

## Impact
~ The fixed gas limits pose the following risks:

>> Transaction Failures - when the hard-coded gas limit is too low for certain operations under heavy network traffic, transactions may fail due to out-of-gas errors.

>> Overpayment - when the gas limit is higher than necessary, users will overpay for transactions, leading to inefficient use of funds.

>> Network Variability - Different network conditions (e.g., mainnet vs. testnet) will require different gas limits, and hard-coding these values will not accommodate such variability.

## Vulnerable Code Snippet
~ This is the [vulnerable code snippet](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-elfi-protocol/blob/main/elfi-perp-contracts/config/common.ts):

 `},
      chainConfig: {
        wrapperToken: 'WETH',
        mintGasFeeLimit: 1_500_000,
        redeemGasFeeLimit: 1_500_000,
        placeIncreaseOrderGasFeeLimit: 1_500_000,
        placeDecreaseOrderGasFeeLimit: 1_500_000,
        positionUpdateMarginGasFeeLimit: 1_500_000,
        positionUpdateLeverageGasFeeLimit: 1_500_000,
        withdrawGasFeeLimit: 1_500_000,
        claimRewardsGasFeeLimit: 1_500_000,
      }, `

## Tool used

~ Manual Smart Contract Code Review

## Recommendation
~ To mitigate this issue, the following recommendations are proposed:

>> Dynamic Gas Estimation - Implement dynamic gas estimation for these operations to adjust the gas limits based on current network conditions.

>> Configurable Parameters - Allow gas limits to be configurable through an administrative interface, enabling adjustments without redeploying the contract.

>> Monitoring and Alerts - Set up monitoring and alerts for gas usage to detect and respond to issues promptly.


## Proposed Fix Code Snippet:
~ Below is a proposed fix code snippet:

`const estimatedGasLimit = await contract.estimateGas.someOperation(parameters);
const gasLimit = Math.min(estimatedGasLimit * 1.2, maxGasLimit); // Adding a buffer
`

N/B: In the proposed fix, we replace the hard-coded gas limits with a dynamic estimation mechanism.
