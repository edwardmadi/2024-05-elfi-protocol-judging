# Withdrawing collateral does not update the total collateral held in the portfolio vault

## Summary
When new collateral is added to users cross account the total collateral token of the portfolio vault incremented. However, it is not decreased when the collateral is withdrawn.
## Vulnerability Detail
When collateral is added the total collateral token hold by the portfolio vault is incremented:
```solidity
function deposit(DepositParams calldata params) external {
        .
        if (DepositFrom.MANUAL == params.from) {
            .
            -> commonData.addTradeTokenCollateral(token, params.amount);
        }
       .
       .
        }
```

When collateral is withdrawn by the user total collateral token hold is not decreased.

## Impact
Total collateral hold will not be accounted correctly. Breaks core contract functionality.
