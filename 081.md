# Critical Flaw in Liability Swap Function

## Summary
A vulnerability has been identified in the `swapPortfolioToPayLiability` function of the smart contract, potentially allowing for a Denial of Service (DoS) attack. The issue arises due to an improper handling of [account liability](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-elfi-protocol/blob/main/elfi-perp-contracts/contracts/facets/SwapFacet.sol#L38-L39) checks within the `_swapSingleLiability` function, which can be exploited by an attacker to front-run legitimate transactions and cause them to revert, thereby disrupting the normal operation of the contract.
## Vulnerability Detail
### FUNCTION INVOLVED
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-elfi-protocol/blob/main/elfi-perp-contracts/contracts/facets/SwapFacet.sol#L16-L31

### Issue in Internal Function
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-elfi-protocol/blob/main/elfi-perp-contracts/contracts/facets/SwapFacet.sol#L38-L40

The function `swapPortfolioToPayLiability` is responsible for swapping portfolio amounts to liabilities for multiple accounts and tokens.
Within this function,` _swapSingleLiability` is called for each account and token.
The `_swapSingleLiability` function checks if the liability of the account for the specified token is greater than zero. If it is zero, the function reverts with the error `Errors.IgnoreSwapWithAccountLiabilityZero`.

### Exploitation Scenario
1. Role of Keeper: The function `swapPortfolioToPayLiability` is intended to be executed by a keeper who provides necessary parameters.
2. Attacker's Strategy: An attacker can monitor the blockchain for the keeper's transaction and front-run it.
3. Deposit to Satisfy Liability: The attacker can call the `deposit` function in the `AccountFacet.sol` contract, fulfilling their liability just before the keeper's transaction is processed.
4. Reversion of Keeper's Transaction: When the keeper's transaction is processed, the liability check in `_swapSingleLiability` fails for the attacker's account and token, causing the transaction to revert.

This exploit can be repeatedly executed by the attacker, leading to a Denial of Service (DoS) where the keeper's transactions are consistently reverted, preventing legitimate operations.
## Impact
The impact of this vulnerability is significant as it can lead to the following issues:

1. Operational Disruption: Keepers are unable to execute their transactions successfully, disrupting the normal functioning of the contract.
2. Economic Loss: The inability to settle liabilities can lead to financial losses and instability.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Instead of using `revert`, use `return` to prevent the entire transaction from halting. This approach will skip the current execution and proceed to the next iteration of the loop for `i` or` j`
