# Keeper pays gas for all withdrawals

## Summary

In all 2-step flows except from withdrawals the users supply the gas fee at creation to compensate the keeper.

As the keeper pays all gas fees for executing withdrawals the system will slowly lose funds. This also enables a griefing opportunity.

## Vulnerability Detail

All 2-step flow gas costs should be covered by the users as otherwise the keeper will slowly lose funds and griefing opportunities arise.

## Impact

Loss of funds for the protocol & griefing potential.
