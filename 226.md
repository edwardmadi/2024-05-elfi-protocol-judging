# The create Withdraw Request lacks any condition checks, making it easy to create a large number of invalid requests


## Summary
The create Withdraw Request lacks any condition checks, making it easy to create a large number of invalid requests
## Vulnerability Detail
```javascript
    function createWithdrawRequest(address token, uint256 amount) external {
        uint256 requestId = UuidCreator.nextId(WITHDRAW_ID_KEY);
        Withdraw.Request storage request = Withdraw.create(requestId);
        request.account = msg.sender;
        request.token = token;
        request.amount = amount;

        emit CreateWithdrawEvent(requestId, request);
    }
```
We can see that The create Withdraw Request lacks any condition checks, so it easy to create a large number of invalid requests. This leads to two adverse consequences: the keeper wastes gas executing or canceling these requests, and due to the large number of invalid requests occupying the keeper’s resources, it becomes difficult for valid requests to be serviced, resulting in a DoS.
