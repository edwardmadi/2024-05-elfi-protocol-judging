# Users loss their payed executionFee if the protocol calls autoReducePositions function

## Summary
autoReducePositions is used only by the risk module. When the Pool is insufficient to support the entire trade PnL, it will trigger the automatic reduction of profitable positions and when this function is called with some specific position keys all of the positions will be closed but in some cases its possible a user creates a stop take profit but when autoReducePositions will be called after that decreasePosition will be called and decreasePosition function cancel stop orders but when cancelStopOrders function will be called that just closes stop orders and that doesn't repay executionFee to users for that stop orders and this causes users loss executeFee for stop orders
## Vulnerability Detail
For example, Alice opens an isolated position in ETHUSD market at 3800 and set take profit at 4500 because Alice creates a take profit order she has to pay executionFee and when ETH reaches 4200 the protocol forces close her position and when closes her position also her take profit order will be closed and she lose her executionFee

## Impact
Users loss their executionFee if the protocol calls autoReducePositions function

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Its fair when protocol management force close some positions for risk  must repay executionFee to users for stop orders
