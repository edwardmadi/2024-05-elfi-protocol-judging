# autoReducePositions function can has significant losses for the protocol

## Summary
autoReducePositions function is used only by the risk module. When the Pool is insufficient to support the entire trade PnL, it will trigger the automatic reduction of profitable positions and the function passes latest usd uint Price as params to decreasePosition function the keeper has to call setOraclePrices function before call this function and if malicious user will be successful to call setOraclePrices before autoReducePositions's calling it can has huge losses for the protocol because every one can call setOraclePrices

## Vulnerability Detail
malicious user sees autoReducePositions function call in mempool and it make a setOraclePrices with high tx fee and with desire price and if miner execute attacker's tx before the keeper's tx this causes the protocol losses its funds
## Impact
autoReducePositions function can has significant losses for the protocol

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
all functions can be called by the keeper they have to get oracle prices as a param
```diff
- function autoReducePositions(bytes32[] calldata positionKeys) external override {
+ function autoReducePositions(bytes32[] calldata positionKeys,OracleProcess.OracleParam[] calldata oracles) external override {
        uint256 startGas = gasleft();
        RoleAccessControl.checkRole(RoleAccessControl.ROLE_KEEPER);
        uint256 requestId = UuidCreator.nextId(AUTO_REDUCE_ID_KEY);
+     OracleProcess.setOraclePrice(oracles);
        for (uint256 i; i < positionKeys.length; i++) {
            Position.Props storage position = Position.load(positionKeys[i]);
            position.checkExists();

            position.decreasePosition(
                DecreasePositionProcess.DecreasePositionParams(
                    requestId,
                    position.symbol,
                    false,
                    position.isCrossMargin,
                    position.marginToken,
                    position.qty,
                    OracleProcess.getLatestUsdUintPrice(position.indexToken, position.isLong)//@audit malicious user can manipulate token price
                )
            );
        }
+     OracleProcess.clearOraclePrice();
        GasProcess.addLossExecutionFee(startGas);
    }
```
