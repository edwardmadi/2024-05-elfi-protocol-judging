# Depositors will  loose extra balance while withdrawing there balance from the protocol.

## Summary
The `updateAllPositionFromBalanceMargin` function in `PositionMarginProcess.sol` is responsible for updating the user's positions when they deposit or withdraw funds. However, a critical vulnerability has been identified in this function, specifically in the handling of withdrawals. This vulnerability can result in the unintended loss of user funds.

## Vulnerability Detail
### Affected Functions
`updateAllPositionFromBalanceMargin`: Iterates through user positions and updates them based on deposit or withdrawal actions.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-elfi-protocol/blob/main/elfi-perp-contracts/contracts/process/PositionMarginProcess.sol#L274-L284
`updatePositionFromBalanceMargin`: Calculates the changeAmount to be applied to each position during the update process.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-elfi-protocol/blob/main/elfi-perp-contracts/contracts/process/PositionMarginProcess.sol#L303-L310
### Issue: 
When a user withdraws funds (amount < 0), if the condition position.initialMarginInUsdFromBalance <= addBorrowMarginInUsd is met, position.initialMarginInUsdFromBalance is set to zero. Subsequently, changeAmount is calculated as zero due to the multiplication by zero. This zero value is then incorrectly passed back to updateAllPositionFromBalanceMargin, leading to an incorrect reduction in reduceAmount.

### Example Scenario:
* User has 2 Position with the same baseTokens let's say USDT, and both are `crossMargin`
 ####       `Positon 1`  -
```solidity
position.initialMarginInUsdFromBalance = 1000USDT
```
 #### `Positon 2 ` 
```solidity
position.initialMarginInUsdFromBalance = 2000USDT
```
* User submits the withdraw request of  `2000 USDT` by  calling the [Withdraw function from AccountFacet.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-elfi-protocol/blob/main/elfi-perp-contracts/contracts/facets/AccountFacet.sol#L40)
* Keeper Executes his withdraw request
* The function [Withdraw of library `AssetsProcess.sol` will be executed](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-elfi-protocol/blob/main/elfi-perp-contracts/contracts/process/AssetsProcess.sol#L122)
* After passing all the checks and all execution will go to [`PositionMarginProcess.updateAllPositionFromBalanceMargin`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-elfi-protocol/blob/main/elfi-perp-contracts/contracts/process/AssetsProcess.sol#L148)
* Then [`updateAllPositionFromBalanceMargin`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-elfi-protocol/blob/main/elfi-perp-contracts/contracts/process/PositionMarginProcess.sol#L274C14-L274C48) function will be executed. It get's all the position key's of the user and run's a for loop for each position(In our case 2 times for loop will run).  I
* For the first loop the check will be passed as it satisfies both the conditions [`token == position.marginToken && position.isCrossMargin`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-elfi-protocol/blob/main/elfi-perp-contracts/contracts/process/PositionMarginProcess.sol#L288)
* `changeAmount` will be calculated using `updatePositionFromBalanceMargin` if we look at the execution of this function, we can check that there are some if else conditions there so the else condition will be passed as amount<0[(If user tries to withdraw, amount will be passed negative)](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-elfi-protocol/blob/main/elfi-perp-contracts/contracts/process/AssetsProcess.sol#L152)
* As explained  issue above, `if (position.initialMarginInUsdFromBalance <= addBorrowMarginInUsd)` this check will get passed and `changeAmount` will be return as 0
* Now the execution will come here [`reduceAmount = amount > 0 ? reduceAmount - changeAmount : reduceAmount + changeAmount;`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-elfi-protocol/blob/main/elfi-perp-contracts/contracts/process/PositionMarginProcess.sol#L295)
```solidity
reduceAmount = amount>0 //This will be false as amount<0 so 2nd condition will be executed
reduceAmount = reduceAmount + changeAmount = reduceAmount  //As Change amount will be zero
```
* Now 2nd for loop will be executed for the `2nd Position` and the amount(2000 USDT) will be debited from that position results in loss of fund for the user
## Impact
* Users will loose there funds
* Locking of funds.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Reduce `position.initialMarginInUsdFromBalance` to zero after calculation of changeAmount.
```diff
- position.initialMarginInUsdFromBalance = 0;
                changeAmount = position.initialMarginInUsdFromBalance.mul(position.initialMargin).div(
                 position.initialMarginInUsd);
+ position.initialMarginInUsdFromBalance = 0;
           
```
