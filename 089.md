# Missing access control `clearLiability`

## Summary
Unauthorized clearing of liabilities can disrupt the accounting system, allowing liabilities to be incorrectly zeroed out by any user, leading to financial inconsistencies and potential abuse.
## Vulnerability Detail
 Any external user can call this function, which can lead to unauthorized clearing of liabilities. 
## Impact
There is no access control in the provided `clearLiability` function. Any external caller can clear the liability for any token.
## Code Snippet
    function clearLiability(Props storage self, address token) external {
        clearLiability(self, token, UpdateSource.DEFAULT);
    }
