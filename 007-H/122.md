# Funds may be stored in the wrong contract on depositing liquidity

## Summary

When LPs provide liquidity the funds should be stored in the given `StakeToken` contract, but they can either land in the `StakeToken` contract or the `PortfolioVault`. When LPs try to redeem their liquidity the system will always try to transfer the funds from the `StakeToken` contract, but if the funds are stored in the `PortfolioVault` the transaction will fail. Therefore the LPs will not be able to redeem their liquidity. Also, the funds are needed in the given `StakeToken` for trading to work properly.

## Vulnerability Detail

There are three different flows when LPs provide liquidity:

- User provides the liquidity from their wallet with the `isCollateral` variable set to false:

  - Transfer funds from the user's wallet to the `LpVault` on creation
  - Transfer the funds from the `LpVault` to the given `StakeToken` on execution

- User provides the liquidity from their wallet with the is `isCollateral` variable set to true:

  - Transfer the funds from the user's wallet to the `PortfolioVault`

- User provides the liquidity from their portfolio:
  - Remove tokens from the user's internal portfolio balance (tokens stay in the `PortfolioVault`)

As we can see in the flows and the given code snippets, the funds can either land in the `StakeToken` contract or the `PortfolioVault`. But the system will always try to transfer the funds from the `StakeToken` contract when LPs try to redeem their liquidity and the funds need to be in the `StakeToken` contract for trading to work properly.

## Impact

DoS / Loss of funds

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Ensure that the funds are always stored in the given `StakeToken` contract when LPs provide liquidity.
