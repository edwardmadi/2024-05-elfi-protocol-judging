# Loss Calculation Bug in Request Execution

## Summary

The protocol incorrectly calculates the loss incurred during the execution of a request. As a result, the protocol will not be able to accurately track its losses.

## Vulnerability Detail

he `GasProcess:processExecutionFee()` function is used to calculate and verify how much the user has paid for executing a request. If the paid amount is less than the actual gas cost, the protocol records a loss. However, due to the incorrect order of operations, the loss is always zeroed out.

```solidity
File: contracts/process/GasProcess.sol
22:         if (executionFee > cache.userExecutionFee) {
23:             executionFee = cache.userExecutionFee;
24:             lossFee = executionFee - cache.userExecutionFee; //@audit always 0
25:         } else {
```

The current logic sets `executionFee` to `cache.userExecutionFee` before calculating `lossFee`, which results in `lossFee` always being zero.

## Impact

The protocol will not correctly record the loss, leading to inaccurate financial tracking and potential mismanagement of funds.

## Code Snippet

- [GasProcess.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-elfi-protocol/blob/8a1a01804a7de7f73a04d794bf6b8104528681ad/elfi-perp-contracts/contracts/process/GasProcess.sol#L22-L25)

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

hange the order of operations to correctly calculate the loss before updating the `executionFee`.

```diff
        if (executionFee > cache.userExecutionFee) {
+           lossFee = executionFee - cache.userExecutionFee;
            executionFee = cache.userExecutionFee;
-           lossFee = executionFee - cache.userExecutionFee;
        } else {
```

This adjustment ensures that `lossFee` is calculated based on the original `executionFee` before it is modified to match `cache.userExecutionFee`.
