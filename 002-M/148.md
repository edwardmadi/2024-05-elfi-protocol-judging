# lossFee always will be zero in process execution fee

## Summary
when user creates a new order and after a while protocol cannot execute the order for any reason and keeper want to cancel the order, protocol has to repay executionFee to user but some time executionFee is greater than userExecutionFee in cancel order time and and protocol want to store gap between executionFee and userExecutionFee as lossFee but lossFee always will be zero because protocol when want to compute lossFee [processExecutionFee function replaces executionFee with userExecutionFee](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-elfi-protocol/blob/main/elfi-perp-contracts/contracts/process/GasProcess.sol#L23) and that cause executionFee always will be equal with userExecutionFee

## Vulnerability Detail
For example if executionFee is 9e15 and userExecutionFee is 8e15
processExecutionFee will replaces executionFee with userExecutionFee and after that for computing uses this formula
lossFee = executionFee - userExecutionFee and lossFee always will be zero because executionFee and userExecutionFee will be equal

## Impact
lossFee always will be zero in process execution fee

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
```diff
        if (executionFee > cache.userExecutionFee) {
-            executionFee = cache.userExecutionFee;
-            lossFee = executionFee - cache.userExecutionFee;
+            lossFee = executionFee - cache.userExecutionFee;
+            executionFee = cache.userExecutionFee;
```
