# `lossFee` is always 0 in `GasProcess.processExecutionFee`

## Summary
`lossFee` is always 0 in `GasProcess.processExecutionFee`

## Vulnerability Detail
lossFee is always 0 because cache.userExecutionFee - cache.userExecutionFee = 0
```solidity
        if (executionFee > cache.userExecutionFee) {
            executionFee = cache.userExecutionFee;
            // @audit lossFee is always 0 because cache.userExecutionFee - cache.userExecutionFee = 0
            lossFee = executionFee - cache.userExecutionFee;
        }
```

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Swap the two lines.
```diff
-           executionFee = cache.userExecutionFee;
-           lossFee = executionFee - cache.userExecutionFee;
+           lossFee = executionFee - cache.userExecutionFee;
+           executionFee = cache.userExecutionFee;
```
