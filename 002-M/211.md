# The `lossFee` is always 0 in the `GasProcess.processExecutionFee()` function

## Summary

In the `processExecutionFee()` function, the `lossFee` is consistently calculated as 0.

## Vulnerability Detail

Since the `executionFee` was set to the same value as `cache.userExecutionFee`, the `lossFee` is consistently calculated as 0. Consequently, the `totalLossExecutionFee` property of the `CommonData` remains unchanged despite an actual loss occurring.

```solidity
            executionFee = cache.userExecutionFee;
            lossFee = executionFee - cache.userExecutionFee;
```

## Impact

The `totalLossExecutionFee` property of the `CommonData` never changes despite actual losses occurring.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

The calculation of the `lossFee` should be done prior to replacing the `executionFee`.

```diff
-           executionFee = cache.userExecutionFee;
            lossFee = executionFee - cache.userExecutionFee;
+           executionFee = cache.userExecutionFee;
```
