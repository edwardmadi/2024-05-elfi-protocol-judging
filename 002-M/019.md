# GasProcess.processExecutionFee() calculates ``lossFee`` wrongly (always zero), and keepers might  oss some portion of execution fee.

## Summary
GasProcess.processExecutionFee() calculates ``lossFee`` wrongly (always zero), and keepers might some portoin of execution fee.

## Vulnerability Detail

GasProcess.processExecutionFee() performs the processing of execution fee: 

[https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-elfi-protocol/blob/main/elfi-perp-contracts/contracts/process/GasProcess.sol#L17-L41](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-elfi-protocol/blob/main/elfi-perp-contracts/contracts/process/GasProcess.sol#L17-L41)

However the following lines will calculate the ``lossFee`` always as zero since executionFee would be equal to cache.userExecutionFee after the assignment. 

```javascript
 executionFee = cache.userExecutionFee;
 lossFee = executionFee - cache.userExecutionFee;
```

Moreover, after this assignement, the keeper will only receive the amount of ``cache.userExecutionFee``, which is smaller than the amount of gas fee that the keeper pays. As a result, the keeper will lose some funds as a result of the execution.



## Impact

GasProcess.processExecutionFee() calculates ``lossFee`` wrongly (always zero), and keepers might some portion of execution fee.

## Recommendation
Delete line 23:

```diff
 if (executionFee > cache.userExecutionFee) {
--            executionFee = cache.userExecutionFee;
            lossFee = executionFee - cache.userExecutionFee;
        } else {
            refundFee = cache.userExecutionFee - executionFee;
        }
```
