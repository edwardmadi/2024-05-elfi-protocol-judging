# Loss Fee does not get added due to wrong calculation

## Summary
When the `ROLE_KEEPER` executes a transaction, we check if the execution_fee is sufficient to cover the transaction cost. If any amount remains, it is refunded to the user, and if the fee is insufficient, the excess amount is added to the loss amount. However, in the event of a loss, the loss amount is not correctly calculated and therefore not added due to an error in the calculation

## Vulnerability Detail
Whenever user submit a request for any operation we charge `executionFee` in advance . The `ROLE_KEPPER` will submit the request operation and will charge the `exectuion_fee`. Here one pf the following 2 cases can occur.
1. The execution Fee was sufficient and the remaining amount sent back to users.
2. The executionFee was insufficient and loss added to Protocol.
In 2nd case there is an Issue due to which the Loss will never be added.
```solidity
    function processExecutionFee(PayExecutionFeeParams memory cache) external {
        uint256 usedGas = cache.startGas - gasleft();
        uint256 executionFee = usedGas * tx.gasprice;
        uint256 refundFee;
        uint256 lossFee;
        if (executionFee > cache.userExecutionFee) {
@>            executionFee = cache.userExecutionFee;  
 @>           lossFee = executionFee - cache.userExecutionFee;

        } else {
            refundFee = cache.userExecutionFee - executionFee;
        }
        VaultProcess.transferOut(
            cache.from,
            AppConfig.getChainConfig().wrapperToken,
            address(this),
            cache.userExecutionFee
        );
        VaultProcess.withdrawEther(cache.keeper, executionFee);
        if (refundFee > 0) {
            VaultProcess.withdrawEther(cache.account, refundFee);
        }
        if (lossFee > 0) {
            CommonData.addLossExecutionFee(lossFee);
        }
    }
```
From above code We can observed that when `executionFee>cache.userExecutionFee` then we first assign `executionFee = cache.userExecutionFee` and then calculate `LossFee` , So `LossFee` will always be zero.
```solidity
executionFee = 10 gwei;
cache.userExecutionFee = 9 gwei;
// we first assign 
executionFee = cache.userExecutionFee; // so Here executionFee = 9 gwei
lossFee = executionFee - cache.userExecutionFee;// 9 gwei - 9 gwei =0
        if (lossFee > 0) { // here lossFee=0 so it will not be added
            CommonData.addLossExecutionFee(lossFee);
        }
```

## Impact
`processExecutionFee` will never added any loss occur.
