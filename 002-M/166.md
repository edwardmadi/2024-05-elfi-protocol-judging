# Incorrect calculation of the `lossFee` in the `GasProcess.processExecutionFee()` function.

## Summary

In the `processExecutionFee()` function, the `lossFee` is always miscalculated to 0.

## Vulnerability Detail

At `L24`, the `lossFee` is calculated. However, the `executionFee` was already adjusted to the same value as `userExecutionFee`. Consequently, the `lossFee` is consistently calculated as 0. This leads to the inaccurate modification of the `CommonData`.

```solidity
        if (executionFee > cache.userExecutionFee) {
23          executionFee = cache.userExecutionFee;
24          lossFee = executionFee - cache.userExecutionFee;
        } else {

        [...]

39          CommonData.addLossExecutionFee(lossFee);
```

## Impact

The incorrect calculation of the `lossFee` leads to the improper modification of the `CommonData`.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

The `GasProcess.processExecutionFee()` function should be fixed as follows.

```diff
-           executionFee = cache.userExecutionFee;
            lossFee = executionFee - cache.userExecutionFee;
+           executionFee = cache.userExecutionFee;
```
