# `processExecutionFee` function from `contracts/process/GasProcess.sol` has a logic error that makes `lossFee` always being `0`

## Summary
`processExecutionFee` function from `contracts/process/GasProcess.sol` has a logic error that makes `lossFee` always being `0` regardless of the arguments `processExecutionFee` function is called with.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `processExecutionFee` function from `contracts/process/GasProcess.sol` is implemented like so:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-elfi-protocol/blob/main/elfi-perp-contracts/contracts/process/GasProcess.sol#L17-L41

Let's look at the following lines in detail:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-elfi-protocol/blob/main/elfi-perp-contracts/contracts/process/GasProcess.sol#L22-L24

When `executionFee > cache.userExecutionFee`, `lossFee` should be set to `executionFee - cache.userExecutionFee` directly, which means `lossFee` should have a positive value. However, in the current implementation, the line:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-elfi-protocol/blob/main/elfi-perp-contracts/contracts/process/GasProcess.sol#L23

is executed first, making `executionFee` and `cache.userExecutionFee` equal in value and after that the line:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-elfi-protocol/blob/main/elfi-perp-contracts/contracts/process/GasProcess.sol#L24

is executed, setting `lossFee` to `0`, which is incorrect.

## Impact
Since currently `lossFee` is always `0` in the `processExecutionFee` function from `contracts/process/GasProcess.sol`, `CommonData.addLossExecutionFee(lossFee);` from the snippet below:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-elfi-protocol/blob/main/elfi-perp-contracts/contracts/process/GasProcess.sol#L38-L40

is never executed. Thus, `totalLossExecutionFee` will have smaller value than it should, which leads to incorrect fees calculation.

## Code Snippet
The issue is in the following 2 lines:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-elfi-protocol/blob/main/elfi-perp-contracts/contracts/process/GasProcess.sol#L23-L24

To fix the issue, these 2 lines should be exchanged.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement `processExecutionFee` function from `contracts/process/GasProcess.sol` in the following way in order to fix the issue:

```diff
    function processExecutionFee(PayExecutionFeeParams memory cache) external {
        uint256 usedGas = cache.startGas - gasleft();
        uint256 executionFee = usedGas * tx.gasprice;
        uint256 refundFee;
        uint256 lossFee;
        if (executionFee > cache.userExecutionFee) {
-           executionFee = cache.userExecutionFee;
-           lossFee = executionFee - cache.userExecutionFee;
+           lossFee = executionFee - cache.userExecutionFee;
+           executionFee = cache.userExecutionFee;
        } else {
            refundFee = cache.userExecutionFee - executionFee;
        }
        VaultProcess.transferOut(
            cache.from,
            AppConfig.getChainConfig().wrapperToken,
            address(this),
            cache.userExecutionFee
        );
        VaultProcess.withdrawEther(cache.keeper, executionFee);
        if (refundFee > 0) {
            VaultProcess.withdrawEther(cache.account, refundFee);
        }
        if (lossFee > 0) {
            CommonData.addLossExecutionFee(lossFee);
        }
    }
```
