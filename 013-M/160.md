# The `AccountFacet` contract lacks a gas refund mechanism for the keeper.

## Summary

The `executeWithdraw()` and `cancelWithdraw()` functions can only be called by the keeper, but they lack a gas refund mechanism for the keeper.

## Vulnerability Detail

Due to the absence of a gas refund mechanism in the `AccountFacet` contract, the keeper incurs a loss when executing user withdrawals. In the worst case, the keeper could lose the ability to execute user withdrawals due to insufficient gas funds, leading to a potential Denial-of-Service for user withdrawals.

## Impact

The keeper incurs a loss when executing user withdrawals. Furthermore, user withdrawals could be `DoS`ed due to the keeper's lack of gas funds.
