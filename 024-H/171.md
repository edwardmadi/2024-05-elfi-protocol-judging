# Reversal of the `PositionMarginProcess._executeReduceMargin()` function due to an integer underflow.

## Summary

In the `_executeReduceMargin()` function, the `position.initialMargin` value is reduced by the `reduceMarginAmount`. However, if the `reduceMarginAmount` is greater than the `position.initialMargin`, the transaction will be reverted.

## Vulnerability Detail

As shown at `L386`, the `reduceMarginAmount` is calculated based on the current price of the `marginToken`. If the current price is significantly lower, the calculated `reduceMarginAmount` could be greater than the `position.initialMargin`. In this case, the transaction will be reverted at `L394`.

```solidity
        uint8 decimals = TokenUtils.decimals(position.marginToken);
        uint256 marginTokenPrice = OracleProcess.getLatestUsdUintPrice(position.marginToken, !position.isLong);
386     uint256 reduceMarginAmount = CalUtils.usdToToken(reduceMargin, decimals, marginTokenPrice);
        
        [...]

394     position.initialMargin -= reduceMarginAmount;
```

Let's consider the following scenario:

1. `initialMarginInUsd = 120000`
2. `initialMargin = 40`(old price was `3000`)
3. `reduceMargin = 90000`
4. `marginTokenPrice = 2000`(dropped significantly from the old price)

In this case, the `reduceMarginAmount` is calculated as `90000 / 2000 = 45`, which is greater than the `initialMargin` of 40. As a result, the transaction will be reverted.

## Impact

Could lead to a reversal of the reducing position margin.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It is recommended to implement a mechanism that reduces the margin amounts based on the proportion between the `reduceMargin` and the `initialMarginInUsd` values, similar to the approach used in the `updatePositionFromBalanceMargin()` function.
