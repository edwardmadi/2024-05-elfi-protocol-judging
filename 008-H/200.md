# Accounting error due to Execution fee being charged to wrong vault

## Summary
Fee is charged from the wrong vault when a mint stake request is created with the native token.

## Vulnerability Detail
Users call `StakeFacet::createMintStakeTokenRequest` when they want to stake to a pool. At the creation of this request the `executionFee` that will be used for its execution is sent to the LpVault or PortfolioVault. When the `requestToken` is native token, the fee is sent to LpVault, and when the `requestToken` is crypto token, the fee is sent to PortfolioVault. However, the issues lies where `requestToken` is native and `isCollateral` is true.
When `requestToken` is native, its `walletRequestTokenAmount` which icludes the `executionFee` is sent to LpVault, even when it was initially deposited in the . 
When is `isCollateral` is true, all  `walletRequestTokenAmount` is sent to the portfolioVault, even if the `requestToken` is native.
The issue is that the protocol pays or attempts to pays for all native token `requestToken` with funds from the LpVault, even when it was initially deposited in the portfolioVault. Attack can use this as a nob to scramble the accounting of the system, as the attack cost is near zero.


## Impact
Accounting error causes insufficient funds in one vault preventing proper functioning of the protocol that relies on that funds being available.

## Code Snippet
When `isCollateral` is true,  `walletRequestTokenAmount` is sent to the portfolioVault

```js
		AssetsProcess.depositToVault(
			AssetsProcess.DepositParams(
				account,
				params.requestToken,
				params.walletRequestTokenAmount,
				params.isCollateral ? AssetsProcess.DepositFrom.MINT_COLLATERAL : AssetsProcess.DepositFrom.MINT,
				params.isNativeToken
			)
		);

```js
	if (DepositFrom.MANUAL == params.from || DepositFrom.MINT_COLLATERAL == params.from) {
		targetAddress = vault.getPortfolioVaultAddress();
	}
```

When `requestToken` is native, `executionFee` is deducted from LpVault.

	(uint256 walletRequestTokenAmount, bool isExecutionFeeFromLpVault) = MintProcess
				.validateAndDepositMintExecutionFee(account, params);

	if (params.isNativeToken && params.walletRequestTokenAmount >= params.executionFee) {
		return (params.walletRequestTokenAmount - params.executionFee, true);
