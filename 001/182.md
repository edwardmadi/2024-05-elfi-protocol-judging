# Loss of Funds to Protocol Due Incorrect Report of Repaid Borrowed Margin

## Summary
Protocol incorrectly decreases positions `initialMarginInUsdFromBalance` from balance when they attemt to acquire more borrowedMargin.

## Vulnerability Detail
When`PositionMarginProcess::updateAllPositionFromBalanceMargin` is called to handle the payment of `borrowedMargin` for the positions in an account, the positions are iterated over and `PositionMarginProcess::updatePositionFromBalanceMargin` is called to handle each position. 
`reduceAmount` is set to amount before the loop begins and is continously updated with the changes made for each `updatePositionFromBalanceMargin` operation. `reduceAmount` is decreased by `changeAmount` when we paying back our borrowed margin (amount > 0), and increased when we are borrowing more margin (amount < 0). This effectively spreads the payment or debt across the account positions. 
Note that the [loop is broken](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-elfi-protocol/blob/8a1a01804a7de7f73a04d794bf6b8104528681ad/elfi-perp-contracts/contracts/process/PositionMarginProcess.sol#L296-L298) if `reduceAmount == 0`, meaning the repay or debt amount has been completely distributed.

The problem lies in `PositionMarginProcess::updatePositionFromBalanceMargin` when `amount < 0 && position.initialMarginInUsdFromBalance <= addBorrowMarginInUsd`, i.e. when we are borrowing more margin, and have `position.initialMarginInUsdFromBalance` that is less than the desired borrow amount `addBorrowMarginInUsd`. 
*Note that `initialMarginInUsdFromBalance` in this case isn't necessary zero or less, just lower than what is to be borrowed.*
The protocol sets the  `position.initialMarginInUsdFromBalance` to zero, and returns changeAmount of zero.
*Note that it sets `position.initialMarginInUsdFromBalance = 0` before multiplying it to other values, which results zero*
This means that despite decreasing the `position.initialMarginInUsdFromBalance` to zero, it reports zero spend out of the original borrow `amount`, causing no effect to the `reduceAmount` in `updateAllPositionFromBalanceMargin`.
This issue is further highlighted by the logical inconsistency with the operation.  
Whether `initialMarginInUsdFromBalance` is less than `addBorrowMarginInUsd` or equal to `addBorrowMarginInUsd`, It clears the positions `initialMarginInUsdFromBalance` and return thesame signal as when a position's `initialMarginInUsd` is equal to its `initialMarginInUsdFromBalance` as [inferred from the first line the functon](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-elfi-protocol/blob/8a1a01804a7de7f73a04d794bf6b8104528681ad/elfi-perp-contracts/contracts/process/PositionMarginProcess.sol#L309-L312). This is obvious incorrect, as the mere fact that the initial if condition wasn't met, means the `position.initialMarginInUsd != position.initialMarginInUsdFromBalance`, and `position.initialMarginInUsd > 0` because `position.initialMarginInUsdFromBalance` was greater than zero before the update.

## Impact
This results in a loss of funds for users, as reporting zero `changeAmount` back to `updateAllPositionFromBalanceMargin` causes the loop to wipe out the `initialMarginInUsdFromBalance` for the position without any compensation. This can unjustly force accounts into liquidation.


## Code Snippet
`reduceAmount` is decreased by `changeAmount` when we paying back our borrowed margin (amount > 0), and increased when we are borrowing more margin (amount < 0).
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-elfi-protocol/blob/8a1a01804a7de7f73a04d794bf6b8104528681ad/elfi-perp-contracts/contracts/process/PositionMarginProcess.sol#L295
```js
	reduceAmount = amount > 0 ? reduceAmount - changeAmount : reduceAmount + changeAmount;
```

It clears the positions `initialMarginInUsdFromBalance` and return thesame signal as when a position initialMarginInUsd is equal to its initialMarginInUsdFromBalance as inferred from the first line the functon: `position.initialMarginInUsd == position.initialMarginInUsdFromBalance `

```js
	if (position.initialMarginInUsd == position.initialMarginInUsdFromBalance || amount == 0) {
		changeAmount = 0;
		return 0;
	}
```

## Tool used
Manual Review


## Recommendation
Move `position.initialMarginInUsdFromBalance = 0;` to come after changeAmount calculation to return the correct `changeAmount` value.

```diff
if (position.initialMarginInUsdFromBalance <= addBorrowMarginInUsd) {e

	changeAmount = position.initialMarginInUsdFromBalance.mul(position.initialMargin).div(
                    position.initialMarginInUsd
                );
+	position.initialMarginInUsdFromBalance = 0;
```
