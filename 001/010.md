# PositionMarginProcess.updatePositionFromBalanceMargin() returns the wrong ``changeAmount`` value for the case ``position.initialInUsdFromBalance <= addBorrowInUsd``.

## Summary
``PositionMarginProcess.updatePositionFromBalanceMargin()`` returns the wrong ``changeAmount`` value for the case ``position.initialInUsdFromBalance <= addBorrowInUsd``.

## Vulnerability Detail
``PositionMarginProcess.updatePositionFromBalanceMargin()`` will modify ``position.initialMarginInUsdFromBalance`` based on the input ``amount`` and different cases. For each case, the actual ``changeAmount`` will be calculated and returned. 

However, for the case ``position.initialInUsdFromBalance <= addBorrowInUsd`` (L327), the wrong ``changeAmount`` is calculated as below:

The main problem is that at L326, ``position.initialMarginInUsdFromBalance = 0;``, and then the ``changeAmount`` is calculated based on the new value of ``position.initialMarginInUsdFromBalance``, which is zero. As a result, the ``changeAmount`` will always be zero. Actually,  ``changeAmount`` should be calculated based on the old value of ``position.initialMarginInUsdFromBalance``. 

## Impact
PositionMarginProcess.updatePositionFromBalanceMargin() returns the wrong ``changeAmount`` value, leading the logical errors to other callers such as ``updateAllPositionFromBalanceMargin`` and the calculation of margins, possible loss to users and/or the system. 

The event at L336 will not be imitted when ``changeAmount`` is mistakenly caculated as zero, applications based on the event will have logical errors as well

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Change the order of the two statements like the following: 

```javascript

 if (position.initialMarginInUsdFromBalance <= addBorrowMarginInUsd) {
                changeAmount = position.initialMarginInUsdFromBalance.mul(position.initialMargin).div(
                    position.initialMarginInUsd
                );
                position.initialMarginInUsdFromBalance = 0;                
            } else {
                position.initialMarginInUsdFromBalance -= addBorrowMarginInUsd;
                changeAmount = (-amount).toUint256();
            }
```
