# Improper Implementation of ReentrancyGuard

## Summary

Some facets in the project use the `ReentrancyGuard` from OpenZeppelin, which utilizes a state variable to store its status. This could complicate future upgrades. The project is built using the Diamond pattern, which operates as a proxy. The entry point is the `Diamond.sol` contract (proxy), which serves as state storage for the facets' local variables.

## Vulnerability Detail

The issue arises if a newly added facet has a state variable that can overwrite the `ReentrancyGuard` status (stored in slot 0). The project uses the `DiamondStorage` pattern and `namespaces` to structure stored data and avoid collisions. Each facet has its own storage and namespace.

However, `ReentrancyGuard` does not fit well with the project's storage management assumptions.

Additionally, the project has an `AppStorage` contract shared across the application, fixed at slot 0, which exacerbates the situation's seriousness.

For example, in `OrderFacet.sol:batchCreateOrderRequest()`, the `nonReentrant` modifier uses a local state variable, and `AppConfig` uses `AppStorage`, loaded from slot 0. This is mitigated only because AppStorage uses a structure containing only mappings, which have dynamically allocated slots.

```solidity
File: contracts/facets/OrderFacet.sol
51:     function batchCreateOrderRequest(
52:         PlaceOrderParams[] calldata params
53:     ) external payable override nonReentrant {
54:         address account = msg.sender;
55:         Account.Props storage accountProps = Account.loadOrCreate(account);
56:         uint256 totalExecutionFee;
57:         AppConfig.ChainConfig memory chainConfig = AppConfig.getChainConfig(); //audit
```

## Impact

The reentrancy guard status variable can be overwritten by other facets' local state variables, causing reentrancy protection to fail. This can lead to critical vulnerabilities in the system.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Follow the guidelines from the Diamond pattern creator and avoid using local state variables. Instead, store everything in `AppStorage`.

Here is a reference for a safe implementation:

- [Beanstalk ReentrancyGuard](https://github.com/BeanstalkFarms/Beanstalk/blob/master/protocol/contracts/beanstalk/ReentrancyGuard.sol)

Consider implementing a custom `ReentrancyGuard` that stores its status in `AppStorage`. This would ensure the reentrancy status variable does not collide with other state variables from different facets, maintaining the integrity and security of the contract.
