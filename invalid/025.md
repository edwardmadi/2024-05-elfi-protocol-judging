## Summary
The `Keeper` role is a restricted role, but can call All two-phase commit functions (functions starting with 'execute' in Facet), and most methods have `OracleProcess.OracleParam[] calldata oracles`. For such methods, keeper Price manipulation is possible
## Vulnerability Detail
For example: 
`OrderFacet::executeOrder()`,keeper can easily complete price manipulation and obtain profits from it.
```js
    function executeOrder(uint256 orderId, OracleProcess.OracleParam[] calldata oracles) external override {
        uint256 startGas = gasleft();
        RoleAccessControl.checkRole(RoleAccessControl.ROLE_KEEPER);
        Order.OrderInfo memory order = Order.get(orderId);
        if (order.account == address(0)) {
            revert Errors.OrderNotExists(orderId);
        }
        OracleProcess.setOraclePrice(oracles);
        OrderProcess.executeOrder(orderId, order);
        OracleProcess.clearOraclePrice();
        GasProcess.processExecutionFee(
            GasProcess.PayExecutionFeeParams(
                order.isExecutionFeeFromTradeVault
                    ? IVault(address(this)).getTradeVaultAddress()
                    : IVault(address(this)).getPortfolioVaultAddress(),
                order.executionFee,
                startGas,
                msg.sender,
                order.account
            )
        );
    }
```
## Impact
The `Keeper` role is a restricted role, but can call All two-phase commit functions (functions starting with 'execute' in Facet), and most methods have `OracleProcess.OracleParam[] calldata oracles`. For such methods, keeper Price manipulation is possible

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
It is recommended to redesign the method of price acquisition. Keeper should not be passed as a parameter. Even if there is price verification inside the update price method, as long as it is not 100% accurate, the keeper will be profitable.
