# `Public` access control functions such as `grantRole`, `revokeRole` and `renounceRole` will fail as `ADMIN_ROLE` role is not it's own admin

## Summary
In `contracts/vault/Vault.sol`, a new role called `ADMIN_ROLE` is getting used for admin tasks. Unlike `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` the `ADMIN_ROLE` has no admin to manage it. Even though the contract defines specialised methods `grantAdmin` and `revokeAdmin` these provided methods from OpenZeppelin's AccessControl will fail:
1. `grantRole`
2. `revokeRole` 
3. `renounceRole`

## Vulnerability Detail

This happens due to the `modifier` present in each of these functions. For example consider the OZ's code for `grantRole` as described in `Code Snippet` section. Here this call, even though publicly available to be called will fail due to `onlyRole(getRoleAdmin(role))`. Here `getRoleAdmin(ADMIN_ROLE)` will return `0x0` and the `msg.sender` won't have this role assigned.

## Impact

OpenZeppelin's public facing functions will fail.

## Code Snippet

```javascript
    function grantRole(bytes32 role, address account) public virtual override onlyRole(getRoleAdmin(role)) {
        _grantRole(role, account);
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Update [Vault's constructor](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-elfi-protocol/blob/main/elfi-perp-contracts/contracts/vault/Vault.sol#L12C1-L14C6)

```diff
    constructor(address admin) {
        _grantRole(ADMIN_ROLE, admin);
+       _setRoleAdmin(ADMIN_ROLE, ADMIN_ROLE);
    }
```
