# Incorrect Margin Calculation in createOrderRequest Function Leading to Potential Inaccurate Margin Holdings

## Summary
The vulnerability exists in the `createOrderRequest` function where it assigns the order margin directly without converting it to USD for non-native tokens. This could result in inaccurate margin holdings, especially for cross-margin orders involving various tokens, leading to potential financial inaccuracies and risks for the protocol.

## Vulnerability Detail
imagine this scenario 
- Bob deposits 100 sol
- he creates a crossMargin order request with order margin  of 100 sol
- then this line executes 
```solidity
if (Order.PositionSide.INCREASE == params.posSide && order.isCrossMargin) {
            accountProps.addOrderHoldInUsd(orderMargin);
        }
```
- which in this doesn't convert the orderMargin which is 100 sol to it's usd value which may lead to inaccuracies in margin calculations

## Impact
Inaccuracies in margin calculations

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Verify the margin token and do the usd conversion in case if the margin token is not a stablecoin
