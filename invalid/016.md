# Keeper can drain the contract using `cancelMintStakeToken()`

## Summary
Keeper role can drain the contract by using reentrancy when calling `cancelMintStakeToken`

## Vulnerability Detail
When a user wants to have tokens minted, they must call `createMintStakeTokenRequest` and either deposit the required sum or have it provided beforehand. If that user has the `ROLE_KEEPER` they can use `cancelMintStakeToken` to drain the contract. When the function is called the funds are first transferred back to the user and then the request is deleted afterwards. That creates an easy opportunity for a reentrancy attack. Because the only place where the deposited sum is registered is in the existence of the request, if it is not deleted yet, that means the user has not withdrawn their funds. 

## Impact
Contact can be drained
