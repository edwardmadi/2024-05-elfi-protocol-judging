# Missing Function Signature in Diamond Proxy Contract Deployment

## Summary
During the deployment of the Diamond Proxy Contract, an issue has been identified where the function present in the facets but not being added correctly. Specifically, the `cancelClaimRewards()` function from `feefaucet.sol` is missing from the interface `IFEE.sol`. This oversight results in the absence of this function's signature in the facet list, potentially leading to unintended disruptions in the protocol's functionality.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the Diamond Proxy pattern, facets are used to implement specific functionalities which can be added or removed dynamically. During the deployment, each facet's interface is used to generate function signatures, which are then included in the facet list. These function signatures are crucial for routing calls to the correct facet functions.

However, it has been observed that the `cancelClaimRewards()` function present in `feefaucet.sol` is not included in the `IFEE.sol` interface. This omission leads to the absence of the `cancelClaimRewards()` function signature during the deployment process.

## Impact
Users who will want to cancel there `clamReward` request they will not be able to cancel it.

## Recommendation
Update the Interface: Include the `cancelClaimRewards()` function in the `IFEE.sol` interface.
