# Future upgrades may be difficult or impossible

## Summary

The project uses nested structures to store data, which may complicate or make future upgrades impossible. In extreme cases, upgrades could lead to data inconsistency and improper system operation.

## Vulnerability Detail

The project uses a structured storage scheme, allowing data in the form of structures to be appropriately linked with facets, theoretically enabling easy updates. However, a problem may arise in future updates because some of these structures contain nested structures that cannot be expanded without "corrupting" the data stored after them in the parent structure.

```solidity
File: contracts/storage/LpPool.sol:20
    struct Props {
       [...]
        TokenBalance baseTokenBalance; //audit struct
        EnumerableSet.AddressSet stableTokens;
        mapping(address => TokenBalance) stableTokenBalances;
        mapping(address => FeeRewards) tradingFeeRewards;
        BorrowingFee borrowingFee; //audit struct
        uint256 apr;
        uint256 totalClaimedRewards;
    }

```

```solidity
File: contracts/storage/Position.sol:12
   12:     struct Props {
   13:         bytes32 key;
  [...]
   27:         PositionFee positionFee; //audit struct
   28:         int256 realizedPnl;
   29:         uint256 lastUpdateTime;
   30:     }

```

This is a problem analogous to storage gaps in upgradable contracts, but in a more advanced and complicated form, which is why it should be rated as medium.

## Impact

Using nested structures for data storage complicates future upgrades. In extreme cases, this can lead to data inconsistency and improper system operation, which is particularly dangerous in financial systems.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To enable safe extension of inner structures in future upgrades, avoid directly nesting structures. Instead, use mappings, which allow extending structures without the risk of overwriting existing state variables.

### Example Solution

Instead of directly nesting structures, place them in mappings:

```solidity
mapping(uint256 => TokenBalance) tokenBalances;
mapping(uint256 => BorrowingFee) borrowingFees;
```

Access them using constants:

```solidity
uint256 constant BASE_TOKEN_BALANCE = 0;
uint256 constant BORROWING_FEE = 1;

// Accessing the values
TokenBalance storage baseTokenBalance = tokenBalances[BASE_TOKEN_BALANCE];
BorrowingFee storage borrowingFee = borrowingFees[BORROWING_FEE];
```

In this way, if there is a need to extend the inner structure in future upgrades, it can be done without the risk of overwriting existing state variables.

#### Reference
> Do not put structs directly in structs unless you donâ€™t plan on ever adding more state variables to the inner structs. You won't be able to add new state variables to inner structs in upgrades without overwriting existing state variables.
