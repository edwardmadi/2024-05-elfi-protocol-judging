# Inadequate Handling of Token Transfers in `cancelOrder`

## Summary
The `cancelOrder` function may fail to transfer tokens out of the vault correctly when canceling orders that are not cross-margin but should transfer tokens. 
## Vulnerability Detail
The issue arises if `VaultProcess.transferOut` fails to execute the transfer correctly or if it doesn't handle all edge cases, such as network congestion, insufficient gas, or smart contract state inconsistencies.

When a user decides to cancel a non-cross-margin order that has an INCREASE position side, the cancelOrder function is triggered. The function correctly removes the order from the system and emits an event to log this action (emit CancelOrderEvent).

However, due to a potential oversight in the smart contract code, the transfer of tokens associated with the canceled order may not execute as intended like insufficient gas. If `VaultProcess.transferOut` fails to properly facilitate the transfer or does not account for all necessary conditions (such as gas limits or token-specific constraints), the tokens intended to be returned to the user could remain locked within the vault.



## Impact
Token Lock-Up: Failure to transfer tokens out of the vault effectively can result in locked assets, preventing users from accessing their funds as expected.

## Recommendation
Consider edge cases such as invalid orders, insufficient funds, or unexpected contract states to ensure the function behaves predictably and safely.
