# Incorrect Conversion Functions Leading to Inaccurate Token and USD Calculations

## Summary
The functions `usdToToken` and `tokenToUsd` in `CalUtils.sol` fail to accurately convert between USD and tokens due to incorrect handling of decimals. This inaccuracy can lead to financial discrepancies across various parts of the protocol that rely on these conversions.

## Vulnerability Detail
Scenario: Converting USD to Token
Context:
- tokenUsdAmount = 100 USD (8 decimals) => 100 * 10^8
- tokenDecimals = 18
- tokenPrice = 1 USD (8 decimals) => 1 * 10^8
- PRICE_TO_WEI = 10^10
Calculation
 ( (100 * 10 ** 8) * ( 10 ** 18) ) / (10**8 * 10 ** 10) => 100 * 10**8 
which wrong as the expected result is 100 * 10 ** 18

Scenario: Converting Token to USD
Context:
- tokenAmount = 100 (18 decimals) => 100 * 10^18
- tokenDecimals = 18
- tokenPrice = 1 USD (8 decimals) => 1 * 10^8
- PRICE_TO_WEI = 10^10
Calculation
 ( ( 100 * 10^18 ) * ( 1 * 10^8 * 10^10 ) ) /  10^18 => 100 * 10^18
which wrong as the expected result is 100 * 10^8

## Impact
-Incorrect conversion rates can cause users to receive incorrect token amounts or USD equivalents.
-Multiple functions relying on these conversions may exhibit erratic behavior, potentially leading to financial losses or incorrect collateral/liquidation calculations.
