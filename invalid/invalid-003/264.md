# Unchecked External Calls

## Summary
Calls to external contracts such as IVault, IWETH, and IERC20 are not checked for success. This can lead to situations where the external call fails (e.g., due to a revert or an out-of-gas error), but the contract continues execution as if the call succeeded. This can result in inconsistent state
## Vulnerability Detail

## Impact
* Inconsistent State: If an external call fails but the contract does not handle the failure, the contract's state may become inconsistent, leading to potential vulnerabilities and unexpected behavior.
* Loss of Funds: Unchecked external calls can result in funds being locked or lost if the intended transfer or operation does not complete successfully.

## Recommendation
Utilize low-level calls and verify return values to ensure the success of external calls. This can be achieved by employing the call method and confirming the return value.
