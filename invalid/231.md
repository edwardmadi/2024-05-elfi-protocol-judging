# `validateAndDepositMintExecutionFee` incorrect validation of inputs 
## Summary
The `validateAndDepositMintExecutionFee` function does not sufficiently validate the `msg.value` input sent by users. Specifically, the function accepts any `msg.value` amount sent with transactions, regardless of whether it matches the required execution fee. This lack of validation can lead to unexpected behavior and potential loss of funds.

## Vulnerability Detail
The function relies on msg.value matching params.executionFee for Ether payments. If there's inadequate validation on msg.value, an attacker could send incorrect or insufficient Ether (msg.value) to manipulate contract behavior.
### Scenario : Excess msg.value Sent
- Description: A user initiates a transaction to mint stake tokens using the validateAndDepositMintExecutionFee function, sending an amount of msg.value that exceeds the required execution fee.Alice sends a transaction with 1 ether as msg.value to cover the execution fee for minting.

- Issue: The `validateAndDepositMintExecutionFee` function is executed, but it does not validate the exact amount of msg.value required for the transaction.
The contract accepts the excess msg.value without validation. It does not refund the excess amount back to the user or utilize it for the intended transaction.
- Consequence: The excess funds sent by the user remain within the contract without a mechanism for retrieval or proper utilization. This can lead to a loss of funds for the user.Instead of refunding the excess 0.5 ether (1 ether - 0.5 ether), the contract does not handle this excess amount.

- User Impact: Users may inadvertently lose funds due to the contract's failure to validate and handle excess `msg.value` appropriately. 


## Impact
resulting in a loss of funds.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- Implement strict checks and validations on inputs (`params.executionFee, msg.value`) to ensure they meet expected requirements.
- Use require statements with appropriate error messages to enforce correct input values.
