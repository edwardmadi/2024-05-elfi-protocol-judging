# DOS attack to Account.hasOtherOrder() and its caller functions such as OrderFacet.executeOrder.

## Summary
DOS attack to Account.hasOtherOrder() and its caller functions such as OrderFacet.executeOrder.

## Vulnerability Detail

Consider the following implementation of Account.hasOtherOrder():

[https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-elfi-protocol/blob/main/elfi-perp-contracts/contracts/storage/Account.sol#L280-L288](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-elfi-protocol/blob/main/elfi-perp-contracts/contracts/storage/Account.sol#L280-L288)

The line ``uint256[] memory orderIds = self.orders.values();`` will run out of gas if there are too many orderIds since each one needs to be copied into the memory. 

An attacker can launch creating many orders to cause a DOS to Account.hasOtherOrder() and its callers. 

For example, DOS can be launced to OrderFacet.executeOrder since it has the following call flow: OrderFacet.executeOrder() -> orderProcess.executeOrder() -> _executeIncreaseOrder() -> accountProps.hasOtherOrder(orderId).

## Impact
DOS attack to Account.hasOtherOrder() and its caller functions such as OrderFacet.executeOrder.

## Recommendation
Use a mapping or use the length of the array to reimplement the function.
