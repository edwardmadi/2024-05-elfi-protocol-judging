# Sybil attacker to claim more reward fee

## Summary
An attacker can transfer stakeTokens between several of their accounts to boost their  realisedRewardsTokenAmount without actually staking that amount of tokens.


## Vulnerability Detail

When `MintProcess::executeMintStakeToken` is called during an LP staking process, the function utilitizes the `FeeRewardsProcess::updateAccountFeeRewards` library to enable the LP collect their unclaimed rewards. The reward received by the staker is a product of the users existing stakeTokens balance and the difference between CumulativeRewardsPerStakeToken and openRewardsPerStakeToken. This presents an issue as the rewards system can be manipulated by manipulating the users balance. To maximize their reward, an attacker can transfer stakeTokens between several of their accounts to boost their  realisedRewardsTokenAmount without actually staking that amount of tokens.

## Impact
Attack games the system to extract more reward than supposed.

## Code Snippet

```js
	uint256 stakeTokens = IERC20(stakeToken).balanceOf(account);
	if (
		stakeTokens > 0 &&
		feeProps.getCumulativeRewardsPerStakeToken() - accountFeeRewards.openRewardsPerStakeToken >
		feeProps.getPoolRewardsPerStakeTokenDeltaLimit()
	) {
		accountFeeRewards.realisedRewardsTokenAmount += (
			stakeToken == CommonData.getStakeUsdToken()
				? CalUtils.mul(
					feeProps.getCumulativeRewardsPerStakeToken() - accountFeeRewards.openRewardsPerStakeToken,
					stakeTokens
				)
				: CalUtils.mulSmallRate(
					feeProps.getCumulativeRewardsPerStakeToken() - accountFeeRewards.openRewardsPerStakeToken,
					stakeTokens
				)
		);
	}
```

## Recommendation
Utilize an internal record of account than relying on the raw balance of users.
