# Stakers cannot redeem their funds

## Summary
StakeToken is responsible for redeeming users funds and in some ways StakeToken doesn't have sufficient balance to repay, if when staker wants to stake at first deposits a specific amount and when wants to stake set requestTokenAmount equals to deposit amount and set walletRequestTokenAmount to zero that its mean staker wants to reduce stake amount from its balance but when staker selects this way the protocol doesn't transfer any value to StakeToken and because of this protocol cannot redeem staker's funds because StakeToken's balance is zero
## Vulnerability Detail
For example:
1-Alice deposits 10 WETH 
2-Alice stakes 10 WETH with params = {
                ....
                requestToken: WETH,
                requestTokenAmount: 10 ether,
                walletRequestTokenAmount: 0 ether,
                isCollateral: false,
               ....
}
in this way the protocol reduce 10 ether from Alice's balance
and this situation Alice's stake amount is 10 ether and stakeToken balance is zero
3-Alice create redeem request with this params 
IStake.RedeemStakeTokenParams({
            receiver : Alice's address,
            stakeToken: _stakeTokenAddr,
            redeemToken: WETH,
            unStakeAmount: Alice's stake token balance,
            minRedeemAmount:0,
            executionFee: _executionFee
        });
when keeper want to execute order will be unsuccessful and get TransferErrorWithVaultBalanceNotEnough error
