# Users cannot get their profit when their positions are profitable

## Summary
the Protocol uses StakeToken to pay profit to users and StakeToken gets sufficient balance from two way , first when stakers mint tokens and second when users open isolated positions their funds transfer to stakeToken and there is a problem stakers can choose corresponding funds for minting reduce for their balance and if stakers choose this way [any token doesn't transfer to StakeToken](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-elfi-protocol/blob/main/elfi-perp-contracts/contracts/process/MintProcess.sol#L80) and in this way StakeToken's balance just come from isolated positions and this cause vault doesn't have sufficient balance to pay profits
## Vulnerability Detail
1-Staker deposits 10 WETH in its account[WETH stake token balance = 0]
2-[Staker mints stakeToken and pay from its account[WETH stake token balance = 0]](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-elfi-protocol/blob/main/elfi-perp-contracts/contracts/process/MintProcess.sol#L80)
3-[Alice opens isolated position with orderMargin 1 WETH at $3800 with leverage 3x[WETH stake token balance = 1 WETH]](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-elfi-protocol/blob/main/elfi-perp-contracts/contracts/process/OrderProcess.sol#L152)
4-Bob opens isolated position with orderMargin 1 WETH at $3800 with leverage 3x[WETH stake token balance = 2 WETH]
5-Alice closes her position at $4000 and the protocol has to pay 1.092 WETH to Alice[WETH stakeToken balance = 0.907 WETH]
6-Bob closes his position at $4000 and the protocol doesn't pay any profit to Bob because StakeToken doesn't have sufficient balance


## Impact
Users cannot get their profit when their positions are profitable

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Its better when staker mints token and select reduce from their balance the protocol transfers corresponding value from vault to stakeToken address
