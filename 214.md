# Using the .call() method to refund the refundFee In processExecutionFee may result in excessive gas consumption and potential reentrancy attacks.

 
## Summary
Using the .call() method to refund the refundFee In processExecutionFee may result in excessive gas consumption and potential reentrancy attacks.
## Vulnerability Detail
```javascript
        function processExecutionFee(PayExecutionFeeParams memory cache) external {
        uint256 usedGas = cache.startGas - gasleft();
        uint256 executionFee = usedGas * tx.gasprice;
        uint256 refundFee;
        uint256 lossFee;
        if (executionFee > cache.userExecutionFee) {
            executionFee = cache.userExecutionFee;
            lossFee = executionFee - cache.userExecutionFee;
        } else {
            refundFee = cache.userExecutionFee - executionFee;
        }
        VaultProcess.transferOut(
            cache.from,
            AppConfig.getChainConfig().wrapperToken,
            address(this),
            cache.userExecutionFee
        );
        VaultProcess.withdrawEther(cache.keeper, executionFee);
        if (refundFee > 0) {
@>>            VaultProcess.withdrawEther(cache.account, refundFee);
        }
        if (lossFee > 0) {
            CommonData.addLossExecutionFee(lossFee);
        }
    }

```

```javascript
  function withdrawEther(address receiver, uint256 amount) internal {
        address wrapperToken = AppConfig.getChainConfig().wrapperToken;
        IWETH(wrapperToken).withdraw(amount);
@>>        safeTransferETH(receiver, amount);
    }

    function safeTransferETH(address to, uint256 value) public {
@>>        (bool success, ) = to.call{ value: value }(new bytes(0));
        require(success, "STE");
    }
```
Cache.account could be a contract, and an attacker could implement various complex logic in the receive() function of this contract to consume a large amount of keeper’s gas. It could even potentially call diamond, causing a reentrancy attack.
## Impact
The attacker could implement various complex logic in the receive() function of this receive contract to consume a large amount of keeper’s gas. It could even potentially call diamond, causing a reentrancy attack.
