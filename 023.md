# Contracts Are Vulnerable To Fee-On-Transfer Accounting-Related Issues

## Summary
Contracts Are Vulnerable To Fee-On-Transfer Accounting-Related Issues - Medium

## Vulnerability Detail
The `depositToVault` of AssetsProcess function transfers funds from the caller to the receiver using `safeTransferFrom()`, but does not ensure that the actual number of tokens received is the same as the input amount. If the token is a fee-on-transfer token, the received balance will be smaller than expected, leading to potential accounting discrepancies.

## Impact
This vulnerability can result in accounting issues where the expected balance does not match the actual balance. It may allow attackers to exploit latent funds, possibly mistakenly sent by another user, to gain unauthorized credits.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
        } else {
            IERC20(token).safeTransferFrom(params.account, targetAddress, params.amount);
        }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To mitigate potential vulnerabilities and ensure accurate accounting with fee-on-transfer tokens, modify your contract's token transfer logic to measure the recipient's balance before and after the transfer. Use this observed difference as the actual transferred amount for any further logic or calculations.
