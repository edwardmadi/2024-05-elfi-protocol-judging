# Lack of Access Control in executeWithdraw and cancelWithdraw

## Summary
The functions `executeWithdraw` and `cancelWithdraw` are marked as external, allowing any address to call them. This absence of access control permits unauthorized users to execute or cancel withdrawal requests, potentially resulting in unauthorized fund transfers or denial of service attacks.
## Vulnerability Detail

## Impact

* Unauthorized Fund Transfers: Malicious actors can execute withdrawal requests they do not own, leading to unauthorized transfers of funds from the contract.
* Denial of Service: Malicious actors can cancel legitimate withdrawal requests, preventing users from accessing their funds and causing a denial of service.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement access control to restrict these functions to authorized users. Utilize role-based access control mechanisms, such as Ownable or AccessControl from OpenZeppelin.
