# No re-entrancy protection in deposit function

## Summary
```deposit``` function does not have reentrancy protection leading to multiple deposit from same amount

## Vulnerability Detail
Contract native balance i.e. ```ETH``` will be drained as malicious attacker will deposit amount in contract by calling through a malicious contract having a function that call ```deposit``` function in a loop.
```solidity
    function deposit(address token, uint256 amount) external payable override {
        if (amount == 0) {
            revert Errors.AmountZeroNotAllowed();
        }
        bool isNativeToken = token == address(0);
        if (isNativeToken && msg.value != amount) {
            revert Errors.AmountNotMatch(msg.value, amount);
        }
        if (!isNativeToken && !AppTradeTokenConfig.getTradeTokenConfig(token).isSupportCollateral) {
            revert Errors.OnlyCollateralSupported();
        }
        address account = msg.sender;
        AssetsProcess.deposit(
            AssetsProcess.DepositParams(
                account,
                isNativeToken ? AppConfig.getChainConfig().wrapperToken : token,
                amount,
                AssetsProcess.DepositFrom.MANUAL,
                isNativeToken
            )
        );
    }
```
As ```msg.value``` persist over calls, so calling  ```deposit``` function will have multiple ETH deposits that uses the same msg.value in each of them, resulting in multiple deposits, that sums up to much bigger accounted value than actually deposited value, up to contract's ETH holdings.

## Impact
The calling of ```deposit``` function in a loop by a malicious contract, results in making multiple deposits that will allow an attacker to drain whole contract. The draining is possible as ```msg.value``` will be used multiple times and ```ETH``` balance will increase.
The ```ETH``` balance will then be withdraw by attacking draining the whole contract balance.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The recommendation is made to use OpenZeppelinâ€™s ```ReentrancyGuard``` library which provide protection to re-entrancy through modifier ```nonReentrant```.
