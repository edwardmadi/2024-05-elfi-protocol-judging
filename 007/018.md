# LpPool.unholdStableToken() will always fail due to a logical error, thus a user cannot unhold stable tokens and loss funds.

## Summary
LpPool.unholdStableToken() will always fail due to a logical error, thus a user cannot unhold stable tokens and loss funds. 

## Vulnerability Detail

LpPool.unholdStableToken() allows one to unhold held stable tokens.

Unfortunately, the following condition is wrong: 

```javascript
require(self.stableTokenBalances[stableToken].holdAmount < amount, "sub hold bigger than hold");
```
The condition should be ``self.stableTokenBalances[stableToken].holdAmount >= amount``, instead of ``self.stableTokenBalances[stableToken].holdAmount < amount``.

As a result of this logical error, this function will always fail: when ``self.stableTokenBalances[stableToken].holdAmount >= amount``, the require statement will fail; otherwise, the following line (L313) will have a underflow error. 

```javascript
self.stableTokenBalances[stableToken].holdAmount -= amount;
```

In summery, this function will always fail, as a result, a user cannot unhold stable tokens and lose funds.



## Impact

LpPool.unholdStableToken() will always fail due to a logical error, thus a user cannot unhold stable tokens and loss funds. 

## Code Snippet

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
change the condition to :

```javascript
require(self.stableTokenBalances[stableToken].holdAmount >= amount, "sub hold bigger than hold");
```
