# Incorrect Margin Balance Update Leads to Loss of Funds

## Summary
The protocol causes permanent loss of funds for itself or the users due to a vulnerable implementation logic for `PositionMarginProcess::updateAllPositionFromBalanceMargin`.


## Vulnerability Detail
When`PositionMarginProcess::updateAllPositionFromBalanceMargin` is called to handle the payment of `borrowedMargin` for the positions in an account, the positions are iterated over and managed individually by `PositionMarginProcess::updatePositionFromBalanceMargin`. The aim is to spread the borrow or repay amount across all the account positions until it is exhausted.
This is achieved with two variables: `reduceAmount` and `changeAmount`.
`reduceAmount` is set to amount before the loop begins and is continuously updated with the changes made for each `updatePositionFromBalanceMargin` operation. `reduceAmount` is decreased by `changeAmount` when we paying back our borrowed margin (`amount > 0`), and increased when we are borrowing more margin (`amount < 0`). This effectively spreads the payment or debt across the account positions.
Note that the [loop is broken](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-elfi-protocol/blob/8a1a01804a7de7f73a04d794bf6b8104528681ad/elfi-perp-contracts/contracts/process/PositionMarginProcess.sol#L296-L298) if `reduceAmount == 0`, meaning the repay or debt amount has been completely distributed.

However, accounting issues can arise when `reduceAmount` transitions from a `< 0` or `> 0` value to the opposite without hitting `==0`, and all the account positions has not been iterated through.

## Impact
In the above situation mentioned above: 
- When an account is repaying its borrowed margin the protocol, cleanse of the debt of some of the positions that hasn't been provision for by the amount, resulting in a net loss for the protocol. 
- Conversely, when borrowing more margin, the account increases the debt of the account beyond what was specified.


## Code Snippet
```js
    function updateAllPositionFromBalanceMargin(...) external {
        if (amount == 0) {
            return;
        }
        bytes32[] memory positionKeys = Account.load(account).getAllPosition();
        int256 reduceAmount = amount;
        for (uint256 i; i < positionKeys.length; i++) {
            Position.Props storage position = Position.load(positionKeys[i]);
            if (token == position.marginToken && position.isCrossMargin) {
                int256 changeAmount = updatePositionFromBalanceMargin(
                    position,
                    originPositionKey.length > 0 && originPositionKey == position.key,
                    requestId,
                    amount
                ).toInt256();
                reduceAmount = amount > 0 ? reduceAmount - changeAmount : reduceAmount + changeAmount;
                if (reduceAmount == 0) {
                    break;
                }
            }
        }
    }
```



## Tool used

Manual Review


## Recommendation
- Use reduceAmount in `updatePositionFromBalanceMargin` instead of amount to capture the updated state of the `amount` value.
- Expand `reduceAmount == 0` check at the end of the function, to be less strict.
```diff
  function updateAllPositionFromBalanceMargin(...) external {
		// ...
		int256 reduceAmount = amount;
			for (uint256 i; i < positionKeys.length; i++) {
				Position.Props storage position = Position.load(positionKeys[i]);
				if (token == position.marginToken && position.isCrossMargin) {
					int256 changeAmount = updatePositionFromBalanceMargin(
						position,
						originPositionKey.length > 0 && originPositionKey == position.key,
						requestId,
-						amount
+						reduceAmount
					).toInt256();
					reduceAmount = amount > 0 ? reduceAmount - changeAmount : reduceAmount + changeAmount;
					if (reduceAmount == 0) {
						break;
+					}else if(amount > 0 and reduceAmount < 0){
+						break;
+					}else if(amount < 0 and reduceAmount > 0) {
+						break;
+					}
				}
			}
    }
```

Furthermore, the logic in updatePositionFromBalanceMargin should be double check to ensure it doesn't utilize more than the provided amount value.
