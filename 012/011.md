# Access Control Vulnerability in `OracleFacet:setOraclePrices` Function.

## Summary
The contract under review is ```OracleFacet```, which includes a function ```setOraclePrices``` that sets oracle prices by calling a function from the ```OracleProcess``` library. The identified vulnerability relates to improper access control in the ```setOraclePrices``` function, allowing any external entity to manipulate oracle prices.

## Vulnerability Detail

The function ```setOraclePrices``` in the ```OracleFacet``` contract allows any external caller to invoke it. This function directly calls ```OracleProcess.setOraclePrice```, setting the oracle prices without any access control or authorization checks.

## Impact

* Price Manipulation: Since there are no access control mechanisms, any external user can call this function and manipulate the oracle prices. This can lead to severe financial implications, including incorrect pricing of assets, manipulation of market positions, and potential exploitation of price discrepancies.

* Security Risks: Allowing unrestricted access to such a critical function exposes the system to malicious attacks, including flash loan attacks, where an attacker could manipulate oracle prices temporarily to profit from arbitrage opportunities.
